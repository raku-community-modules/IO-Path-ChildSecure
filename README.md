# NAME

IO::Path::ChildSecure -Secure version of IO::Path.child

# SYNOPSIS

```raku
use IO::Path::ChildSecure;

# good; you get IO::Path
"foo".IO.&child-secure: 'meow';

# still good if 'foo/meow/foo/bar/../' exists; Failure if it doesn't
"foo".IO.&child-secure: 'meow/foo/bar/../meow';

# bad; path isn't a child; you get Failure
"foo".IO.&child-secure: '../';
```

# DESCRIPTION

In the Raku Programming Language v6.c,
[`IO::Path.child`](https://docs.raku.org/type/IO::Path#method_child) isn't
secure, in a sense that it does no checks for whether the resultant path is
actually a child of the original path.

# EXPORTED SUBROUTINES

## `&child-secure`

```raku
"foo".IO.&child-secure: 'meow'; # good; you get IO::Path
"foo".IO.&child-secure: 'meow/foo/bar/../meow'; # still good
"foo".IO.&child-secure: '../';  # bad; path isn't a child; you get Failure

child-secure "foo".IO, '../';  # can also use as a proper sub
```

Appends the given path chunk to the invocant and ensures the resultant path
is, in fact, a child of the invocant, by accessing the filesystem and
fully-resolving the path. The last chunk of the resultant path does not have
to exist for the resolution to succeed.

Will [`fail`](https://docs.raku.org/routine/fail) with `X::IO::Resolve` if
failed to fully resolve the resultant path
or with `X::IO::NotAChild` if the resultant path is not a child of the invocant.

# SPECIAL NOTES

- Module requires Rakudo 2017.04 or newer and will `die` on earlier versions
  (more specifically, anything earlier than dev version
    v2017.03.292.g.0.b.5.a.41.ba.8)
- If you don't need to ensure secureness, use the much-faster core
  [`IO::Path.add` method](https://docs.raku.org/type/IO::Path#method_add)
